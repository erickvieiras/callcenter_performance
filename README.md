# CALLCENTER PERFORMANCE
### PORTUGUESE PT-BR VERSION BELLOW
# PROJETC
This Project uses fictitious and public data simulating the activities of a call center departament over the last 3 years, following technical support for internet and telephone products to evaluate business metrics, actionable insights for decision making and department performance.

The activities are established as a client of the base requests guidance or technical assistance over the telephone, from this contact the needs for repair or support for the treatment or the client are assessed.

# Metrics:

Among the metrics evaluated in the dataset, we can highlight:


Age of the Employee;

Employee time employed;

Current status of the employee;

Employee's educational level
Academic training of the Employee;

Work modeling;

Day period;
Date of each service;

Number of calls per employee;
Number and type of service orders per employee;

Value generated per service order;

Individual performance of each employee;

# Insights:

## Department:

The department is made up of 10 active employees, and in the last 3 years there has been a 100% turnover of employees. Between the years 2020 and 2021 the department had a turnover rate of 20% based on the number of active employees, and in the years between 2022 and 2023 an increase of 50% compared to previous years.
This indicates the departure of 2 employees from the department each year, and in the last 2 years this rate has increased to 3. Indicating a growing trend in layoffs in the department due to changes in position or dismissal.

The department has a rate of 40% employees with an academic degree, 30% university students or a related field, and 30% technical or high school level. Therefore, 60% of employees do not have an academic degree.

We identified that the length of time an employee remains in the department does not negatively influence their individual performance. 100% of evaluated employees who have been with the company for between 5 and 8 years have a performance above 70.9%.

Analyzing the trend in seasonal call behavior, it is clear that the lowest maximum and average service recorded by the department is in 2023, maintaining a downward trend since 2020, with a 63.84% drop in the last 3 years.

By the year 2023, 74% of the department works in person and 26% of the department works remotely. This performance rate is balanced between work modalities, maintaining a higher performance score of 1.2% for in-person work compared to remote work.

The department has a division of shifts between Day, Night and Dawn. Due to established rules, in the year of the 2020 pandemic, the attendance rate at Dawn Shift from March of that year was suspended until the following year, accounting for only 0.2% of attendances, Day Shift with 58.1% of attendances and Night Shift 41.7%. of services in the same year.

There was an increase in the attendance rate in 2021 compared to the previous year of 12.8% in Day Shift and a reduction of 13.9% in Night Shift. Dawn Shift saw 1.4% growth.

In the year 2022 compared to the previous year there was an increase of 3% in Day Shift, and a reduction of 0.2% in both Night Shift and Dawn Shift.

In the year 2023 there was a 9.1% reduction in Day Shift attendances, during the Night Shift there was an increase of 8.7%.

Finally, Dawn Shift is also an increase of 0.4% compared to the previous year.

As well as daily demands, the department is also responsible for monitoring and issuing repair requests for network infrastructure problems that may affect the customer base.
Carrying out an analysis of the shifts, maintaining the criterion of temporary suspension of services at Dawn Shift during the pandemic period in March 2020, extending into the next year, maintaining the division between shifts with 58.4% of network repair incidents at Day Shift, 40.3% of network repairs in Night Shift and 1.3% in Dawn Shift.

In 2021, there was a 7.5% increase in network repair incidents in Day Shift, an 11.8% reduction in network repair incidents in Night Shift, and a 4.3% growth in Dawn Shift.

In 2022, there was a 0.9% increase in network repair incidents in Day Shift, a 0.4% reduction in network repair incidents in Night Shift, and a 0.4% reduction in Dawn Shift.

In 2023, there will be a 10.6% reduction in network repair incidents in Day Shift, a 10% increase in network repair incidents in Night Shift, and a 0.6% increase in Dawn Shift.

## Performance:

The department's performance score has a downward trend of 1.4% compared to years between 2020 and 2023 and a drop of 59.2% in calls in the last half of the same years.

Through the analyzed data, it is also possible to develop a strategy for acquiring new employees given the analysis of the department's layoffs.

To measure the department's performance, a feature was created in the Feature Engineering stage of the project, where we can calculate the performance of each employee.

The strategy adopted was to extract the percentage of orders generated per service, with this approach we can consider that performance is the problem resolution rate per service.

By assigning an average performance of 70% to a positive score, it is possible to determine the characteristics with an ideal employee profile.

We can see that the ideal acquisition profile for the department are candidates who have a technical level in the area, who are university students or students in related areas or with academic training. The average age is 30 years old, with a variable age range between 22 and 35 years old.


## Business Performance:


Through analysis of the department's demand and performance, we identified that between 2021 and 2023, eligible years with 24-hour service, we identified that Day Shift has an average of 68% of calls from the department with 62.9% in network repair incidents, Night Shift with an average of 30.5% of calls from the department with 31.5% in network repair incidents, while Dawn Shift has an average of 1.4% of calls with 5.4% in network repair incidents.

A strategy to reduce costs, optimize the department and allocate resources within the company would be to exempt Dawn Shift, and automate the process of dispatching incidents for network repairs, as this rate is equivalent to only 1.4% in calls and 5.4% in incidents generated represented by shift per year. Reducing costs with employees on this shift, resources and energy for the operational functioning of equipment.

The trend in the department's average number of registered calls indicates a decline equivalent to 59.2% compared to the years 2020 and 2023.

We can highlight a greater scope in the first and last quarter of the years, an increase in service orders to change equipment sources, which indicates that it is due to summer rains. These costs can generate inconvenience and influence customer churn. To avoid these inconveniences, the dial would be to implement an anti-surge protector on the customer's internal equipment to reduce this frequency and generate more customer satisfaction.

The ideal acquisition profile for the department are candidates who have a technical level in the area, who are university students or students in related areas or with a degree. The average age is 30 years old, with a variable age range between 22 and 35 years old.
These parameters will bring a performance of 71% to 77.8% for the department. This performance represents the percentage of success in calls for repairs and service orders.

# Final Product

The objective of the project is to create an interactive analytical Dashboard with a set of metrics not yet defined by the company, to assist in decision making, strategic analysis of the department and performance.
